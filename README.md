# CaSe4SR
Code for paper "Category-aware Multi-relation Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for session-based recommendation" in Knowledge-Based System 2022

We have implemented our methods in Pytorch and PyG.

## Usage

`python src/main.py`

## Requirements

```
python==3.7
PyTorch==1.11
numpy==1.21.5
PyG==2.0.4
```

## Note
1. We implement this paper by other dataset.
2. The code is rather messy because some deviations in understanding the paper before led to changing part of the code. If there is anything you don't understand about the code, please feel free to contact me.
